                        Breakthroughs in data science and computing power, especially the prevalence of graphical processing
                        units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs) over the past two decades, have made deep learning
                        (DL) one of the most powerful tools in the field of artificial intelligence. DL has been
                        successfully and effectively applied in many cutting edge applications including Automation,
                        Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Object Detection, Drug
                        Discovery etc. Present day DL has amazed everyone with their human level accuracy in classification,
                        generating life-like images and videos and even beating world-champions at their own games. As the
                        quest continues, deep learning has emerged out to be the most sought after skill in today's
                        industrial scenario, right from the Tech Giants to Startups. DL basically uses deep neural network
                        architecture with multiple layers to represent data with increasing abstraction and can be applied
                        to supervised, unsupervised, as well as reinforcement learning.

                        The Workshop on Advances in Deep Learning and Applications (WADLA) was formally formalized in 2021
                        to give the participants hands-on experience, right from the foundations, from some of the leading
                        experts in the fields. Based on the past experience and suggestions of the participants and expert
                        speakers, this time we have officially created an organizing committee consisting of expert people
                        from all over the world. This expert committee is continuously monitoring the activities of this
                        workshop and has finalized the topics covered in the program schedule which reflects the recent
                        trends in deep learning.
